# Smart House

## Project Objectives

We were taske to create a complete and fully functional web based project with database intacted. The project was to cover two months period of development in four people group. After initial brainstorming we settled to create a smarthouse app allowing the user to directly monitor and change smat device states of real life devices. User should be able to access the app both through mobile app and website. As the project continued we chose to implement virtual house model in Unity to better ensure control over devices and to freely change and update their states.

## Authorization MongoDB provider

In order to support the authorization and identification, which includes the user's login, Asp.Identity was used. Our project uses a non-relational MongoDB database, which is why standard Asp.Identity mechanisms working with SQL database had to be modified to work with MongoDB. For this purpose, the "MongoDB.AspNet.Identity" provider created by the "maxiomtech" user was used. This provider enables the use of the benefits of the Asp.Identity package in combination with the use of MongoDB. Instead of using relational database tables to store identity and attribution data, collections of non-relational MongoDB database are used.

## Application Interface

The application interface is made in ASP.NET Framework MVC 5.2 Web Api. Individual methods of the SmartDevicesController are protected against unauthorized access by Asp.Identity using the MongoDB provider. Documentation of individual API methods is included in SwaggerUI, which was attached to the project.
